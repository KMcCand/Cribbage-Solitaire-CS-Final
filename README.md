# Cribbage-Solitaire-CS-Final
final_partC2: GUI that runs a game of Cribbage Solitaire
final_partC1: recursive autosolver to play Cribbage Solitaire, choosing the best move by looking a specified number of moves into the future

These files are part of my CS1 Final Exam at Caltech. My Professors provided me with template files that layed out the structures for final_partA and final_partB and defined the less interesting functions and methods. final_partC1 and final_partC2 inherit from final_partB, which uses the helper methods layed out in final_partA, and with the exception of the help from Stack Overflow that I mention in final_partC2, I wrote these files myself, though the ideas were still given to me as questions on the exam.
